				  <p class = "about"> About <br> The commercial real estate web scraper is developed for our sponsor, Capstak. It is an autonomous scraper that has the ability
to scrape various commercial real estate sites and intelligently consolidate the scraped data into a
database that Capstak will use as desired. The scraper will not only be useful to Capstak,
but also Capstak users as the scraper will aid Capstak in providing recent and relevant real estate data to the end user. <br> <br> Main functionalities of the scraper include being able to run in
AWS, with Groovy being the primary language of the scripts being written. The scripts are able to intelligently handle the data being pulled in
from the broker sites by matching it with the data it had previously pulled and manipulating to reflect most recent updates it if need be.A front end GUI will be developed in order to provide the user with an easy way to operate the web scraper. <br> <br> The scraper is currently under developmen by Alex Sanchez and Austin Ogilvie with the advisment of Ben Lucchesi. The project will be completed in May 2018.</p>
