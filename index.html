		<h3> About </h3>

		<div class="box container">
				  <p class = "about"> <br> The commercial real estate web scraper is developed for our sponsor, Capstak. It is an autonomous scraper that has the ability
to scrape various commercial real estate sites and intelligently consolidate the scraped data into a
database that Capstak will use as desired. The scraper will not only be useful to Capstak,
but also Capstak users as the scraper will aid Capstak in providing recent and relevant real estate data to the end user. <br> <br> Main functionalities of the scraper include being able to run in
AWS, with Groovy being the primary language of the scripts being written. The scripts are able to intelligently handle the data being pulled in
from the broker sites by matching it with the data it had previously pulled and manipulating to reflect most recent updates it if need be. The data will be stored in a MySQL database where it can be easily accessed and manipulated by the user. A front end GUI will be developed in order to provide the user with an easy way to operate the web scraper. <br> <br> The scraper is currently under developmen by Alex Sanchez and Austin Ogilvie with the advisment of Ben Lucchesi. The project will be completed in May 2018.</p>

		<h5>Resources</h5>
		Groovy Programming Language:
		https://www.tutorialspoint.com/groovy/	
		This gave the team an overall great introduction to a new language. Luckily, Groovy is not spectacularly different from any languages the team has used at UNR or in their non-academic experiences. 
		
		Web Scraping in Python using Scrapy:
		https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/07/web-scraping-in-python-using-scrapy/
		This article is an in depth look at different tools that can be used with python. It’s clear and concise and provides some good tips for web scraping. Though it uses python in its examples, it parallels with what we are looking to accomplish and is a great tool to help us learn how to create a full proof design with respect to our Capstak’s needs. 
		
		Is Web Scraping Illegal? Depends on What the Meaning of the Word Is Is.
		https://resources.distilnetworks.com/all-blog-posts/is-web-scraping-illegal-depends-on-what-the-meaning-of-the-word-is-is
		An article that gave great insight to the team in keeping the scraper legal/ethical.
